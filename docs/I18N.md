Internationalization (i18n)

Objectives
- Localize output labels and room type names
- Support Latin, Middle Eastern (RTL), and Asian languages
- Guarantee Unicode handling end-to-end (DB, PHP, terminal)

Approach
- JSON catalogs per locale in resources/i18n/ (e.g., en.json, es.json, ar.json, zh.json)
- Translator loads the requested locale with a fallback to English
- Keys cover:
  - labels.stars, labels.apartments, labels.adults, labels.standard_room
  - roomTypes.single, double, double_view, suite, family
  - entity labels if needed (hotel, apartments)

Right-to-left (RTL)
- Arabic (ar) is RTL. We keep content order consistent and let terminals handle rendering. Labels are RTL strings; numbers remain LTR as usual in technical outputs.

Unicode data
- The database uses utf8mb4 for table and column collations to store names like "فندق النور", "ホテル青", or Chinese characters.

Locale selection
- CLI accepts an optional environment variable APP_LOCALE or reads default_locale from config/config.php

Example output mapping (en)
- Hotel Azul, 3 stars, double with view, Valencia, Valencia
- Apartments Beach, 10 apartments, 4 adults, Almeria, Almeria
